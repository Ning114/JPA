## A Turn-Based Dungeon Crawler

**What will the application do?**

My project this term will be a turn-based dungeon crawler game! The game will have
the following key aspects: 

- The game will be level based, with a safe zone/HUB the player regularly returns to.  
The HUB contains NPCs that provide various services to the player to aid them on their quest.


- Rooms are grid based to easier keep track of movement, position and where objects are placed.
e.g.) each room is a 12 x 12 grid

- Players can level up to increase HEALTH, ATTACK and DEFENCE stats, which alter how effectively
the player can fight.


- There will be aspects of random generation: Rooms will appear in a random layout with
randomly placed objects and hazards. 
Hazards can be things like spikes, traps, or boxes that alter the terrain the player can navigate in.
Loot will also have randomly generated names and stats.

- Players navigate through dungeons in search of loot and experience. Players also have an inventory
system where they can swap out weapons and armor with those they find in the dungeon.

- If there is time to implement such a feature, 
there will be a unique boss at the end of each stage. 

**Who will use this application?**

This application is a video game, so it will be appropriate for anyone who enjoys games.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

My future goal is to become a video game programmer and work somewhere in Japan.
So naturally, I'd want to make a game for my project! I'm also very interested in fantasy
aesthetics and D&D, so this project will be an amalgamation of several things I'm passionate about.
This will be the first 'large' game I have ever built from the ground-up. The only games
I have made before were rudimentary ones (tic-tac-toe, hangman, etc.). 

**User Stories**

The things the player should be able to do include:

- Move their character in the desired direction 
- Pick up items and add them to inventory. Drop items from inventory.
- Switch equipped armor and weapons with those in inventory. 
- Use skill points gained from levelling up to increase the desired stat.
- Have the character's stats altered by equipped armor and weapons
- Attack enemies near the player by walking into them. Attacks can miss or critical hit.
Same goes for enemy attacks on the player.
- Take damage from traps and enemies, or dodge/block them with high enough defense or agility
- Interact with NPCs: speak with them, choose dialogue options, and buy/sell items
